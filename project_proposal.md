# 4.1 Project Proposal 
Due: 11/10 
The project proposal is worth 12% of the project grade. 

 

The idea that we are proposing is an NBA player comparison app, giving users the ability to put two players side by side and using analytics, decide which player is better. It would pull data using the basketball reference website and assign a total point value to players, allowing us to rank all of them.  We will be exploring topics such as data analytics, API calling, as well as front-end design, as we want to make this application display on an aesthetic website.  


Our stretch goal is being able to create multiple algorithms, so that the user can choose HOW they want to rank each player, favoring different variables such as scoring, defense, winning, etc.  

 

# Learning Objectives
 

Because we both have a similar level of knowledge when it comes to this type of project, our shared goals are both our individual learning goals.  
 

Shared goals: 

Learn how to use API’s and analyze the data that we extract.  

Front-end website design and integrating back-end coding to create a complete web application.  

Web scraping 

Different analyzation methods for how we value certain statistics that NBA players may have.  

Front-facing applications, and how to make them run smoothly and aesthetically. 

 

# Implementation Plan
 

We want to use the Basketball Reference website, as we believe it is the most credible and available site for NBA data.  

We are not completely sure how we plan to weight certain statistics, but we believe it will go something along the lines of the fantasy basketball point evaluators. There are plenty of resources online as to how fantasy basketball values its players, so we plan to do something along those lines, but put our own spin and take on what statistics are more valuable than what.  

We know that other player evaluation algorithms out there exist, so we may search the internet for some other ones for guidance for how to construct ours.  

We are not completely sure how to pull data and store data from the NBA basketball reference website, but we know that it has been done before so that is where we will start our research.  

 

# Project Schedule

Week 1 

Experiment with and learn Basketball Reference API formatting and syntax 

Week 2 

Experiment with different data analysis libraries and their compatibility with the API.  

Pick handful of best data analysis libraries 

Week 3 

Write pseudocode and determine weights for player stats.  

Week 4 

Convert pseudocode to Python.  

Week 5 

Integrate code to website 

Week 6 

Finish website and ensure everything works properly 

 

# Collaboration Plan

For the experimenting portion, we will individually test the API and different data libraries and converge with what we found. We will work together on implementing the formula/weights for player stats and writing the pseudocode. We’ll then split the pseudocode up and work separately to convert it to Python. Finally, we’ll split up to write code for each web page. 

We plan to use agile development strategies, because we believe that this is a project that we may have to circle back to multiple steps on, especially because it’s a project that we’ve never undertaken before. There may be certain steps that take us significantly longer than others, so we want to stay flexible for our timeline.  

We will ensure effective team collaboration by assigning certain tasks to certain members, so that we keep each other on track for what we need to do.  

# Risks and Limitations

We believe that the most significant threat to this project’s success is the API availability, or our ability to scrape the NBA reference website to get the data that we need to carry out our analysis.  

A secondary threat will be our ability to determine a general formula for measuring player value. 

A third threat that we consider is time, given that we have no understanding of how long such a project could take.  


# Additional Course Content

APIs 

Data analytics 

Dictionaries, Tuples, Lists.  

We plan on using an API for the Basketball Reference website, which will probably be formatted using some combination of dictionaries and lists.
